### Tinder API Bot - Tinder API Account Creator (SaaS solution)


- Based on the hidden Tinder iOS API.

- ***The Tinder API bot currently works for an exclusive circle of people, there is no public release yet. We were also asked to not publicly release it. But this may change in a few weeks, not sure.***
  
- Compatible with the lastest Tinder 15.23.1 release

- Complete SaaS [^1] solution:

  - Everything runs in the background on our servers 24/7.
  - Setup the workflows once with your favorite browser.
  - Advanced "web panel" solution (2 frontend servers, 10+ backend servers).
  - No installation required.
  - No poor ADB bridge (no connected devices).
  - No poor signer being used. C++ example code here: https://github.com/ReverseAndBot/Tinder-Bot/blob/main/TinderGenerateTokens.cpp
  - No poor browser module.
  - No Appium or XCUITest solution.
  - ***No jailbreaks or tweaks used** (since no physical devices or emulators are required).
  - ***No phones required, no tablets required, no emulators required, no browser emulation required, no own server required.***

- We also offer:

  - ***Custom reverse engineering (e. g. API endpoint detection, jailbreak/emulator/debugger/device detection/... bypassing, SSL unpinning, HTTP/2 and HTTP/3, GRPC, Protobuf, removal of hidden traffic/hidden system calls and much more)***
  - Bot coding for social media apps, dating apps, other apps based on the hidden private APIs for iOS etc.
  - Safari for iOS automation with a perfect anti device detection (XCUITest coded in Swift 5/6, no poor insecure instable Appium solution), ...
  - ***Lists of API endpoints and required signatures, patched iOS apps (with SSL unpinning, jailbreak/device detection/... etc. bypassing, many more)***
  - Trainings and white papers for you to set up your private bots on your own, with a perfect protection, hidden operation and anti-detection methods 
  - White label solutions for resellers and agencies available (neutral design, no copyright notices, no URL/contact mention, optionally your corporate design etc.)
  - Exclusively for you, for you as a future reseller of a white label solution, or to be provided to everyone (cheaper)
  - Optionally non disclosure agreements (NDA) or other contracts
  - We can be your independent freelancers, project partners or consulting people
  - High quality solutions with future updates and support, "Made in West Europe"
  - We don't offer anything "open source" or for free
  - Please contact us to discuss your requirements
