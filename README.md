### Tinder API Bot (SaaS solution)

- Based on the hidden Tinder iOS API.

- Currently under development (as of September 2024)
  
- Compatible with Tinder 15.x.

- Complete SaaS [^1] solution:

  - Everything runs in the background on our servers 24/7.
  - Setup the workflows once with your favorite browser.
  - No installation required.
  - No poor ADB bridge (no connected devices).
  - No poor signer being used. C++ example code here: https://github.com/ReverseAndBot/Tinder-Bot/blob/main/TinderGenerateTokens.cpp
  - No poor browser module.
  - No jailbreaks or tweaks used (since no physical devices are required).
  - No phones required, no tablets required, no emulators required, no browser emulation required, no own server required.

- A few examples of (soon) available modules:

  - Tinder ***Account Creator***
  - Tinder ***Account Ager*** (warm up)
  - Automated Tinder account verification (by SMS)
  - Export of ***Tinder tokens*** (to be used in your own tools)
  - Export of ***Tinder refresh tokens*** (to be used in your own tools)
  - Tinder ***Location Spoofer*** (to set your desired geo location wherever you want, no external app required)
  - Tinder Swiper
  - Tinder ***Chat/Messenger*** incl. auto responder (scheduled messages based on events/keywords)
  - Chat/Messenger supports ChatGPT and/or internal AI and/or Spintax
  - Additional professional options for OnlyFans agencies (OFM)
  - CupidBot replacement (a single setup is enough, everything will run on our servers 24/7 using the Tinder API, without any interaction by you)
  - Interesting new modules and workflows will follow in September 2024 (please talk to us, please "star" this repository)
  - etc.

- List to be continued soon.
